All transozone activity carries risk of exposure to radiation, extreme temperatures, anoxic conditions, extraterrestrial dust, hostile extraterrestrial life, hostile artificial intelligence, and other hazards that may result in permanent injury or death. All itinerant travel carries risk of exposure to radiation, extreme temperatures, anoxic conditions, and other hazards that may result in permanent injury or death. We strongly recommend exercising extreme caution at all times when operating the voidship, especially when outside the orbit of a habitable planet. If conditions inside the voidship's main body become dangerous, the voidship's legs can be used as temporary shelters segregated or ejected from the main body. Only exit the voidship with adequate and redundant life support systems, or when the external environment is confirmed to be habitable. Do not attempt to operate the voidship while intoxicated.

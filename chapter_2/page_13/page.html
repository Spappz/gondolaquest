In writing, Standard Crowman likewise uses a mix of native Crowman glyphs and human scripts, and much like modern Japanese writing the choice of script used is heavily context- and mood-dependent.</p> <p>Generally speaking, casual or long-form prose is written mostly in Crowman glyphs, whereas human scripts are used to write titles and poetry, or as a way to highlight important sections of prose. A writer's specific choice of human script reflects their own aesthetic tastes and desired valence. Mixing different human scripts is traditionally considered bad form in formal writing, but has in recent years been adopted by avant-garde writers.</p><p>It is important to note that even though the three ribbons shown so far use different human scripts (French, Chinese, and English), they all fundamentally represent the same Crowman language, and the same text written in different human scripts would be read aloud in the same way. Interestingly, the original human pronounciations of each script are broadly well-understood among academics, so poets often strive to make their poems sound good in both Crowman and the chosen human language.</p> <p>The character 丫 here (pronounced roughly as /jɒ˧/) means "corvids" or "everyone" or "good" and traces its lineage from multiple sources:</p><img src="crowlang1.png" class="panel"><p>While officially 丫 carries a positive valence (compare with Yiddish <i>mensch</i>), it is also often used sarcastically to refer to unwashed commoners (compare with the English <i>folksy</i>). For instance, the late fourth-cycle poet Li Wu (李乌) used 丫 to deride the nascent republican movement in his scatological poem《咏丫》:</p></li></ol></div><div class="body_center_zh"><p>丫，丫，丫</p><p>开腔满地撒</p><p>黑毛泄白日</p><p>红土泛青天</p></div></div>

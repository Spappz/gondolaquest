      <p>GONDOLA and his SMALL BIRD FRIEND find themselves in a dense TEMPERATE FOREST, bracketed on both sides by ROCKY SLOPES.</p>

      <p>Not far from GONDOLA's landing site, a cleanly cut STONE STAIRCASE winds into the canopy. Its adjacent trees are wrapped in SLOGANED RIBBONS that scream out in busy colors.</p>

      <p>The RIBBONS rustle to greet a warm breeze. It carries the scent of FLOWERS and INDUSTRY.</p>

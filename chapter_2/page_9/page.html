      <p>GONDOLA and his SMALL BIRD FRIEND find themselves at the foot of a well-maintained STONE STAIRCASE. It winds its way up layers of bushes and rocky slopes, into the broken canopy of a TEMPERATE FOREST.</p>

      <p>Along the STONE STAIRCASE, trees host busy RIBBONS that scream at each other in PRIMARY COLORS and BOLD TEXT. Some are wrapped to conceal others, and some on the ground seem to have been torn off outright, but overall it appears that the battle between COLORS has come to a ROUGH STALEMATE.</p>

      <p>The RIBBONS rustle to greet a warm breeze. It carries the scent of FLOWERS and INDUSTRY.</p>

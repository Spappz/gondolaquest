        <p>GONDOLA stands in a rectangular room. Some time ago he wandered here somehow, by unclear means and for unclear reasons. Not that it matters, really. GONDOLA is used to wandering into strange new places.</p>

        <p>As the old copypasta goes:</p>

        <div class="body_quote">
          <p>Gondola was not a mistake.</p>

          <p>Gondolas are relaxed, harmless creatures that observe their environment. They rarely interfere anything, but just keep observing. They rarely talk, just look around and smile. </p>

          <p>...</p>

          <p>Gondola is the silent walker. Having no hands he embodies the Taoist principle of WU-WEI (non-action) while his smiling facial expression shows his utter and complete acceptance of the world as it is.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The idea that WU-WEI means total non-action is not quite right. In the first place, it's a prescription for governance. Rulers acting in accordance to WU-WEI might <i>appear</i> not to govern, if their governance follows the natural inclinations of the people and the movement of all things. To achieve this, they absolutely must still govern. So says Du Guangting:</p>

        <div class="body_quote">
          无为之理，其大矣哉。无为者，非谓引而不来，推而不去，迫而不应，感而不动，坚滞而不流，卷握而不散也。谓其私志不入公道，嗜欲不枉正术，循理而举事，因资而立功，事成而身不伐，功立而名不有。
        </div>

        <p>To react to something bad with a placid smile is not WU-WEI, nor is standing by passively and merely looking on. </p>

        <p>Then again, trying to understand Dao means that one doesn't yet understand Dao, so we probably don't need to belabor the point: the meaning of the copypasta is opaque and it will not be taken literally. WU-WEI is just a city in Anhui.</p>

        <p>GONDOLA is no king. He's a weird little bear thing who wanders around with immense curiosity. Strictly speaking, he does plenty of actions too. He walks and fiddles with objects and touches the hearts of all who encounter him. He is not, however, here on a mission. He will not be saving the world.</p>

        <p>In that case, what should Gondola do?</p>

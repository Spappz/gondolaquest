        <p>GONDOLA looks around and reveals the other side of the room for us. Thanks GONDOLA!</p>

        <p>On one side of the room, pale blue light leaks in from a thick glass WINDOW. A bulky ARCADE MACHINE sits against an adjacent wall, facing what appears to be a SEALED PANEL on the checkered floor.</p>

        <p>Where the walls are otherwise empty, they are adorned with various GONDOLA PAINTINGS, each signed by a certain SEONG.</p>

        <b>FACTORY PAINTING.</b> Pixel-perfect GONDOBOTS emerge from a pixel-perfect machine. Its regularity is broken by a single puff of smoke, which curls timidly inward.

        <b>BEAR PAINTING.</b> GONDOLA is welcomed by a family of... MORE REALISTIC BEARS. Their soft fur presses against the window frame, beckoning the viewer with kindness and warmth.

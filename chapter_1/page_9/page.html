        <p>We know already that GONDOLA can experience joy. He can also experience surprise and fear, as he did when he unwisely ejected the legs. I will remind you that this does not go against the already tenuously applied principle of WU-WEI:</p>

        <div class="body_quote">
          无为之理，其大矣哉。无为者，非谓引而不来，推而不去，迫而不应，感而不动，坚滞而不流，卷握而不散也。谓其私志不入公道，嗜欲不枉正术，循理而举事，因资而立功，事成而身不伐，功立而名不有。
        </div>

        <p>If he can experience apprehension then he should be able to act on it, or at least refuse to do something he does not want to do. This means that some tension can be introduced between GONDOLA and our commands.</p>

        <p>What's left, then, of WU-WEI? I think if GONDOLA "embodies WU-WEI," he should always, a priori, point to the path of least resistance. He should always coincidentally be in the exact right place, at the exact right time, and doing the exact right thing, like a Forrest Gump situation. GONDOLA may fear for his safety, but he will never be seriously hurt.</p> 

        <p>Dr. Pangloss was right. For GONDOLA.</p>
